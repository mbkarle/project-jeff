  header: That guy with the van
  description: >-
    That’s a 23 year old me, with my now 4 year old Border Collie and my then 35
    years old Volkswagen Vanagon. The energy of a border collie puppy, combined
    with the nomadic ethos of a notoriously unreliable adventure vehicle, meant
    that every moment was a new adventure—a new smell, a new place to see, or a
    new road to explore. 


    This drive (no pun intended) to seek new experiences is the same way I approach design. As a designer & creative, I strive to create familiar, delightful and profound experiences by leveraging user centered research, technology & beautiful design.

    I’ve spent the last 6 years across the different surfaces of digital
    design—user research, native mobile design, UX and visual design, applying
    these approaches to problems of all different shapes and sizes.

      description: Former Lightweight Rower @ UPenn, two-time National Champion, and
        100k Lightweight Rowing World Record holder. Now that I live in Boulder,
        my pursuit of movement is focused less on fitness or external
        competition, but instead on finding flow.

      description: As a child of immigrants, I never thought I could do something
        creative for a living. I’m lucky to not only be able to do so, but to
        also continue creating in my life outside of work, whether that’s
        through instruments, paint brushes, a camera lens, and more.

      description: "I try to break out of the cycle of monotonous routine by traveling
        to different places, by plane, van, or truck camper. When road tripping,
        my dog Buster almost always comes with. We’ve driven across the US many
        times—some of our favorite places include Sedona, Moab, and Revelstoke
        (BC). "
