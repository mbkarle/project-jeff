  header: That guy with the van
  description: >-
    That’s a 23 year old me, with my now 4 year old Border Collie and my then 35 years old Volkswagen Vanagon. The energy of a border collie puppy, combined with the nomadic ethos of a notoriously unreliable adventure vehicle, meant that every moment was a new adventure—a new smell, a new place to see, or a new road to explore. 


    This drive (no pun intended) to seek new experiences is the same way I approach design. As a designer & creative, I strive to create familiar, delightful and profound experiences by leveraging user centered research, technology & beautiful design.
