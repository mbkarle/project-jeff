        doing something creative as a profession. Some might describe me as a
        musician, artist, home cook, dog dad, ultrarunner, national champion,
        world record holder, and more...

  cta: Have an idea for the next biggest ______?
  description: >-
    I love startups. I’m always looking for a way to scratch the itch for moving
    quickly and helping shape big ideas. I can do it all—need a pitch deck for a
    fundraise? Looking to clean up your landing page? Need an MVP but don’t know
    where to start? Looking to iterate on your product? Not a problem.


    I’m particularly passionate about crypto, impact/mission driven companies, and products focused on building communities.
